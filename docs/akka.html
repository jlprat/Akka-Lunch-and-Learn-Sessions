				<h3>What is Akka?</h3>
				<p>
					Akka is a toolkit and runtime whose focus is on simplifying the creation of concurrent and distributed
					systems.
					<br>
					Akka is most commonly associated with their actor library.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is Akka?</h3>
				<p>
					However, Akka Platform comprises several modules and libraries:
				<ul>
					<li>Akka (Actors)</li>
					<li>Akka Persistence</li>
					<li>Akka Cluster</li>
					<li>Akka Streams</li>
					<li>Akka HTTP</li>
					<li>Alpakka</li>
					<li>and others...</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is Akka?</h3>
				<p>
					Akka's success comes primarily from bringing the Actor Model (highly inspired by the Erlang one) to the JVM.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is an Actor?</h3>
				<p>Actors organize themselves in parent-children hierarchies. Each parent takes care of their children during
					their complete lifetime.</p>
				<p>And yes:
				<blockquote>&ldquo;One Actor is no Actor. Actors come in Systems.&rdquo;
					<br>
					<small>Carl Hewitt</small>
				</blockquote>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is an Actor?</h3>
				<p>Actors can only communicate with each other using messages. Any attempt to access directly their internal
					state is against the Actor Model.</p>
				<p>Ideally such messages should be immutable.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is an Actor?</h3>
				<p>
					Overly simplifying an actor encapsulates:
				<ul>
					<li>State</li>
					<li>Behavior</li>
					<li>Mailbox</li>
					<li>Children*</li>
					<li>Supervision Strategy*</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: right;"><small>* Optional</small></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is an Actor? - State</h3>
				<p>An Actor without need to store state, most probably is no Actor.</p>
				<p>Akka Actors, provide concurrency safety in regards of their state, meaning, one can safely modify its state
					without worrying about concurrency issues.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is an Actor? - Behavior</h3>
				<p>A behavior is how an actor handles messages. In the end is a function that takes a message and performs any
					given actions.</p>
				<p>Behaviors for an can be dynamically changed.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is an Actor? - Mailbox</h3>
				<p>All messages sent to an Actor are first stored in their mailbox until they can be processed.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is an Actor? - Children</h3>
				<p>Optionally, an Actor can create children to delegate subtasks to them. Unlike in real life, their lifetime is
					controlled by the parent.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is an Actor? - Supervision Strategy</h3>
				<p>Set of rules that define how to react in front of exceptions.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What is an Actor? - ActorRef</h3>
				<p>An <code>ActorRef</code> is the "address we send the messages". It encapsulates the internals of an actor and
					it's their external representation.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>When should I use Actors?</h3>
				<p>If you can solve your problem with a <code>Future</code>, probably you won't need Actors.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>When should I use Actors?</h3>
				<p>Nowadays, Actors are the lowest level of abstraction on the Akka ecosystem. There might be higher
					abstractions that would fit better to your use case.</p>
				<p>For example Akka Streams and Akka HTTP.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>When should I use Actors?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>More than one Actor</li>
					<li>Actors have State</li>
					<li>Actors talk to each other</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Which Actor style to choose?</h3>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3 class="fragment">Classic Akka Actors</h3>
				<pre><code class="scala" data-trim>
					type Receive = PartialFunction[Any, Unit]
				</code></pre>
				<p class="fragment">The main criticism to Akka Actors has always been the lack of any types on their Actors.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Explicit State</h3>
				<pre><code class="scala" data-trim style="font-size: 18px;" data-line-numbers="|4-10|5-7|9|12-20|16-19|15,17|18">import akka.actor.{Actor, Props}
import io.github.jlprat.akka.lnl.intro.classic.MiniExample.{Click, RetrieveClicks}

object MiniExample {
  sealed trait Command
  case object Click extends Command
  case object RetrieveClicks extends Command

  def props(): Props = Props(classOf[MiniExample])
}

class MiniExample extends Actor {

  var clicks: Long = 0

  override def receive: Actor.Receive = {
   case Click => clicks = clicks + 1
    case RetrieveClicks => sender() ! clicks
  }
}					
				</code></pre>

				<h3>Changing Behavior</h3>
				<pre><code class="scala" style="font-size: 18px;" data-line-numbers="|12-20|14|16-19|17|18">import akka.actor.{Actor, Props}
import io.github.jlprat.akka.lnl.intro.classic.MiniExampleBecome.{Click, RetrieveClicks}

  private def clickCounting(count: Long): Actor.Receive = {
    case Click => context.become(clickCounting(count + 1))
    case RetrieveClicks => sender() ! count
  }
}
				</code></pre>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Akka Typed</h3>
				<p>Since Akka <code>2.6.x</code> versions a new type of Actors are available for production use.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Akka Typed</h3>
				<pre><code class="scala" style="font-size: 18px;" data-line-numbers="|4|6-8|10|12-13,18|7,14|8,15-17">import akka.actor.typed.{ActorRef, Behavior}
import akka.actor.typed.scaladsl.Behaviors

object MiniExample {

  sealed trait Command
  case object Click extends Command
  case class RetrieveClicks(replyTo: ActorRef[Long]) extends Command

  def apply(): Behavior[Command] = counting(0)

  private def counting(count: Long): Behavior[Command] =
    Behaviors.receiveMessage {
      case Click => counting(count + 1)
      case RetrieveClicks(replyTo) =>
        replyTo ! count
        Behaviors.same
    }
}
				</code></pre>

				<h3>How do I test Actors?</h3>
				<p>On both Akka Typed and Akka Classic there are 2 different modes for testing: Synchronous and Asynchronous.
				</p>
				<p>Typically asynchronous testing is the preferred one, leaving synchronous testing for the pure unit tests.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Why Asynchronous?</h3>
				<p>It replicates a "live environment" and offers out of the box probes and mocking capabilities. It works for
					advanced Akka features like Clustering.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Why Synchronous?</h3>
				<p>On Akka Typed it's independent from the <code>ActorSystem</code> and is useful to test Actors in isolation.
				</p>
				<p>On Akka Classic, this type of testing is not actively encouraged, but it's useful to check the side effects
					caused by the processing of a message.</p>
